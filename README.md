# Nix Bases

This is a supplementary repository to [docker-images](https://github.com/rse-ops/docker-images)
to provide some nix bases for testing. We are hoping to provide one or more Nix base images
that can be used to build software. For more specific (pre-built) developer environments, please
see [rse-ops/devbox](https://github.com/rse-ops/devbox)
